# Unity-AI-Texture-Generator
This project uses OpenAI's DALLÂ·E 2 to generate textures directly from the Unity Editor.
The API calls are made directly in game by using OkGoDoIt/OpenAI-API-dotnet, a C# OpenAI sdk.

3. Enter a prompt for the texture you want to generate.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Example: "Oak tree bark, realistic"\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Note: All prompts have the string "The following is a texture for use in a video game." appended automatically to the beginning of your prompt.

5. Click generate and wait for your result.
6. The textures will be outputted to a folder in the same directory as the prefab.
